🚢 Titanic Survival Analysis

The Titanic disaster of 1912 is one of the most famous tragedies in history. Beyond the story, the dataset provides fascinating insights into who survived and why.

This project uses Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize and analyze passenger survival patterns based on gender, age, and class.

📊 Visualizations

✔️ Overall Survival Count – passengers who survived vs. died
✔️ Survivors by Gender – comparing male vs. female survival rates
✔️ Age Distribution – how survival varied across ages
✔️ Passenger Class Breakdown – effect of class (1st, 2nd, 3rd) on survival
